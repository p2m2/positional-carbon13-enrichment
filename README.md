<sup>13</sup>C-positional enrichments were calculated by combining mean <sup>13</sup>C enrichments
of several mass fragments that shared part of the carbon backbone from the same TMS
derivative. A workflow has been created to calculate these <sup>13</sup>C-positional enrichments
directly from the outputs of our <sup>13</sup>C-processing method

For a precise description of the method, refer to the publication [*"Evaluation of GC/MS-Based <sup>13</sup>C-Positional Approaches for TMS Derivatives of Organic and Amino Acids and Application to Plant <sup>13</sup>C-Labeled Experiments"*](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13040466)
